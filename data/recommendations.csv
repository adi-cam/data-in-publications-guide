-Make sure that you are writing about the exact same data set as the one used in the data visualisation.
-Make sure that the units of measurement are the same: If you show percentages, write about percentages. You can always mention absolute numbers additionally.
-Make sure that the trends or overall developments described in the text match what can be seen in the visualisation.

In an online publication in which the data – and with it the visualisation – is going to be updated, the text must be dynamic as well. There are multiple options to minimise the amount of  text that has to be completely rewritten every time the data is updated:
-Write the text in a generic way; without numbers and without descriptions of trends or developments. Simply introduce the topic of the data and describe the methodology used to create the data set.
-Outline trends and developments and just update those descriptions.
-State only the values without describing any trends. Those numbers can be updated manually or be programmed to update automatically.

-Ensure you have used the first cell, i.e. A1.
-Avoid white space and additional information in the file.
-Ensure that all rows have the same number of columns.

-Formatting of decimal numbers and numbers in the thousands
-Make use of standardised character encoding
-Use URIs to identify entities

Don’ts
-Don’t use thousand separators such as white spaces and dots.
-Don’t embed charts, comments or tables within a spreadsheet.
-Don’t use colour coding (machine-based data mining cannot interpret this).

These should not distract from the main message of the chart. Instead, they should offer the reader more information on demand and help them explore the visualisation. ","If you are publishing an online publication, make a conscious decision on which interactive chart functionalities you want to offer. They can include:
-Animations that play when the user scrolls to the chart: This feature is often distracting and should only be used if you are aiming for a playful display of your information.
-Tooltip that shows underlying values: Tooltips help readers go into details and read the values without having to download the data. If you are using built-in tooltips, check if they are mobile-friendly.
-Show, hide and highlight aspects of the data: This allows readers to set their own focus in the chart and is especially helpful for people who work with the information in your publication.
-Control what data to show: These features range from a simple date filter to options to change the data source. More advanced features like the later, are usually more suited to a dashboard than to a linear publication with text and visualisations.
-Change how the data is shown: These features allow users to change the chart type and chart design. They usually make the most sense in a dashboard setting.

This means that online content needs to responsively adjust to the screen size the reader is using. Data visualisations are no exception: They need to be designed in a way that layout and font-sizes responsively adjust to the width of the screen.","Often interactive charting tools such as Highcharts come with built-in functionalities for responsive design. If not, check with your developers and designers for which screen sizes you are optimising. In terms of static charts, designers might create multiple versions for different platforms (e.g., one for the PDF-Publication and one for social media platforms).

3A && 5D,Publishing,Provide options to reuse your visualisation on the web,"Provide options to embed your visualisation on other websites
","An embed code is a short script that can be copied and pasted into the code of another website. Embed codes allow others to reuse your web-based charts on their own sites.
",,,,,,,
,Publishing,,Provide options to share your visualisation,"Sharing visualisations are a great way for people to reuse and discuss your work. Share options allow readers to share the visualisation on social media platforms, but can also allow them to copy a direct link to the visualisation and send it via email.
","Many charting tools include an option to provide share buttons alongside the visualisation. Only provide the sharing options that are relevant to your target audience, as to not overload the readers with possibilities.",,,,,,
,Visualisation,,Choose accessible colour combinations and fonts,"One in twelve men and one in two hundert women have some type of colour blindness. Many people also have poor eyesight or suffer from vision impairment. To make your charts more accessible on a visual level, choose accessible colour combinations and fonts.","In choosing accessible fonts and colours, the keyword is “differentiation”. Colours for different categories should be easy to differentiate for people with different colour vision deficiencies. Don’t rely on colour alone to encode variables but add patterns and labels to ensure readability.

Choose a font with characters that are easily distinguishable and are optimised for online reading.  Be sure that your font size isn’t any smaller than 12px.
",,,,,,
,Visualisation,,Write meaningful titles for your visualisations,The title of a visualisation is usually the first – and sometimes the only – element the reader will look at. A meaningful title is a title that summarises the key findings shown in the chart. This helps guide readers through the data and makes the chart self-contained and reusable.,"In the title, try to summarise the main message of the visualisation in less than ten words. Use the subtitle to describe the data, its geography, the time period, and the units of measurement. ",,,,,,
,Visualisation,,Write succinct visualisation legends,"Legends describe how different data variables are encoded in visual elements, thus serving as an instruction on how to read a visualisation. Legends are the key to understanding the visualisation and should therefore be created with considerable care. ","Make sure to keep the wording in your legend consistent, succinct, and short. Defer from using abbreviations and complicated words. Finally, make sure that each visual element is explained. A good way to test if your legend works, is to show it to people outside of your field of expertise. Ask them to describe their thoughts out loud as they try to read the visualisation. ",,,,,,
,Visualisation,,Annotate important features,"Annotations can guide readers towards important aspects of your data. They also provide context to the data, often explaining why certain developments, trends or changes show in the visualisation. ",Identify salient features in your data visualisation: Is there a surprising development? Are there certain points that stand in contrast to the overall statement of the chart? Which features explicitly support the chart’s overall statement? Write short sentences or clauses to explain these features. Use arrows or lines to connect the feature with the annotation. ,,,,,,
,Visualisation,,Make sure your interactive charts are accessible with the keyboard,Not everyone can use a mouse to access content online. Therefore it is important to ensure that charts can be navigated with the keys alone (e.g. with the “Shift” and “Enter” keys). ,"Most interactive charting tools such as Highchart come with integrated keyboard navigation support. If you are using your own tools or implementing a new charting library, make sure to check and, if necessary, implement these features. ",,,,,,
,Visualisation,,Keep future translations in mind,"In contrast to many other international bodies, the European Union is a multilingual organisation. All official languages of member states are also official EU languages. For one, this is to ensure that the general public and national courts can read and understand any applicable EU laws. For another, translated documents ensure democratic discussion and transparency.","When creating a visualisation for a multilingual publication, keep in mind that titles, keys, labels and annotations must all be translated. It is therefore important to keep any text in the visualisation short and succinct. When providing the publication to the translation service, ensure that you provide enough context to avoid that short texts are mistranslated.",,,,,,
,Visualisation,,Makes use of official EU geodata for maps,"The mapping of areas, especially disputed areas, in an official context is an extremely sensitive issue. Carelessly plotted, designed, or labelled maps can cause far-reaching diplomatic incidents. The GISCO (Geographic Information System of the Commission)  team at Eurostat, together with DG COMM and the External Action Service of the EU, are responsible for correctly showing the official position of the EU on territorial conflicts.","When making maps for your publications make use of GISCO’s resources. The GISCO team creates statistical and other thematic maps, manages a database of geographical information, and provides related services to the Commission.",,,,,,
,Visualisation,,"Add appropriate metadata to your visualisation
","Meta data not only ensures that visualisations are cited and attributed correctly, it also makes your charts accessible to people using screen readers and increases searchability online.
","Where and how you add metadata to you visualisations depends on which formats you are using:
-Standalone visualisation (JPEG, TIFF, PNG): Images support IPTC metadata that can be viewed, added or modified with several tools, for example Adobe Bridge 2022.
-Online publication: As metadata embedded in the standalone image files is not read out by screen readers it is good to use HTML-tags for image metadata online. A very important one is the <alt>-tag, which allows you to add descriptive text to the visualisation. If a reader is using the website in accessibility mode, this text will be read out by the screenreader. Charting tools often provide the option to add alt-text without the need to write any code yourself.
-Static publication: In a Word-Manuscript you can add metadata to your visualisations by right-clicking on the image and selecting “Edit Alt Text”. This alt-text remains if the manuscript is converted into a PDF (as opposed to alt-text for tables which is not preserved).

The following information should always be provided in the metadata:
-Title and subtitle
-Description
-Date
-Author and source
