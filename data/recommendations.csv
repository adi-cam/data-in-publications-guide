How you add metadata to your visualisations depends on which formats you are using:
-Standalone visualisation (JPEG, PNG): Images support IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council) metadata that can be viewed, added, or modified with several tools, for example Adobe Bridge 2022.
-Visualisations online: As metadata embedded in the standalone image files is not read out by screen readers, it is good to use HTML-tags for image metadata online.
-Visualisations in PDF publications: In a Microsoft Word manuscript you can add metadata to your visualisations by right-clicking on the image and selecting ‘edit alt text’.

Users might want to download all the visualisations from the publication at once. So be sure to provide both a single-file download option and the option to download a zip-file containing all visualisations.

If you are using an online charting tool to create the visualisations, you can check if it comes with a built-in functionality to add share buttons. Apart from social media and link sharing options, consider giving users the possibility to add your charts to their own websites by providing an embed code (a snippet of HTML code which the user can copy.

,Visualise,ADINA,1,Define the purpose of your data visualisation,"Data visualisations present an insight into your data. They allow readers to compare, organise, make correlations, and see relationships. Each visualisation in your publication should have a single, clearly defined purpose. It should be meaningful and easy to understand."," After you have analysed your data, think about which insights you have gained from it. Then, decide on which of those insights would be interesting to your readers. For example, an insight might be that, over the years, the gender gap in cultural employment has gotten smaller across EU member states. Next, you can translate this insight into a message. Aim to create one visualisation per message you want to convey. Following our example, the message could be: ‘The gender gap in cultural employment is at an all-time low ’. Finally, be sure to check this message against your data again.

In some cases, text or other types of graphics might be more suitable than a data visualisation: If your data has caveats (e.g., a small sample size), a data visualisation might mislead your readers. Likewise, if you have qualitative information rather than quantitative data, it might be better to create an infographic or even just describe the information in a text.",,,,,,
3A,Visualise,DONE,2,Choose the right type of visualisation,"Different chart types encode data in different ways, making different aspects of your data visible. For example, a stacked bar chart allows readers to compare parts to a whole while a line chart shows a development over time. Therefore, it is essential to choose the right chart type to make the message you want to communicate through your data clear and understandable. "," Then choose a chart type (e.g., bar chart, line chart, scatter plot, etc.) that fits the data properties and communicates that aspect. There are various resources that list all available chart types and help you choose the right one (see ‘Resources’ below).

,Visualise,"RESOURCES, FORMATTING",3,Follow best design practices,Following certain design principles can make your data visualisations more attractive and easier to read. Many of these design principles also help make your visualisation more accessible. ,"Consider the following points:
Hierarchy:
-The visualised data should be high in the visual hierarchy while supportive elements, like axes and axes labels, should retreat to the background.
-Font sizes of text elements should reflect their importance
Typography:
-Font choice should take into account the visual identity.
-Use fonts that are designed to be easily legible on a screen. Avoid cursive and fantasy fonts.
-Use font sizes that are 12 points / pixels and larger
-Don't rotate text, it should always stay horizontal.
-Don’t distort fonts.
Alignment:
-Align visualisations to the grid of the publication
-Align elements of a chart to each other
Colour:
-Avoid colours and colour schemes with strong connotations
-Choose colours so that they fit the content of your data
-Pick harmonious colour palettes
-Assure enough contrast between the colours (see recommendation “Choose accessible colour combinations”)
-Negative Space: Use negative space (whitespace) to let your visualisation breath

Make sure these design decisions are consistent across the publication: use the same colours to encode the same variables and use the same font sizes and layout for each chart. A section on data visualisation in your style guide and predefined templates (e.g., in Excel) can help you stay consistent throughout and across publications.

3A,Visualise,"RESOURCES, FORMATTING",4,Follow best data visualisation design practices,"When statisticians began creating and using data visualisations in the 18th century, people had to learn how to read them at first. Today, people have grown used to certain design elements that help them decipher the meaning of a chart. If you want your readers to understand your visualisations quickly and with ease you can make use of those design patterns.
","Some Do's and Don'ts:
Don’t:
-Don’t use 3D-charts. Use 2D-charts instead.
-Don’t create charts with two x-Axes. Put two charts below each other instead.
-Don’t use decoration. Declutter the design instead.
-Don’t overuse lines.
-Don’t use two different x-axes.
-Don’t use inconsistent axes. The y-axes should always start from Zero and the values should be spaced evenly along the x-axes.
-Don’t use vertical text

Do:
-Use a standard visualisation layout: Figure number, title, subtitle, key / legend, chart body, footnote, source, author and licensing
-Order the data in an apparent logic, for example by size or alphabetically
-Label elements directly, if possible
-Highlight important points through colours, shades, and annotations
-Provide context: show missing data, uncertainty ranges, trendlines and benchmarks

,Visualise,ADINA,5,Choose accessible colour combinations,"One in twelve men and one in two hundred women have some type of colour blindness. Many people also have poor eyesight or suffer from vision impairment. To make your charts more accessible on a visual level, choose accessible colour combinations (see recommendation ‘Write alt text for your visualisation’). Under EU law, public body websites and mobile apps have to be accessible to persons with disabilities, including people with visual or hearing impairments. In HTML, essential accessibility requirements are outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which defines three levels of compliance: A (represents the absolute minimum requirements for basic accessibility), AA, and AAA. Since 2010, all new websites under the EUROPA domain have to be built according to level AA.","In choosing accessible colours, the keyword is ‘contrast.’ The WCAG defines contrast as a measure of the difference in perceived brightness between two colours. The colours you use should have enough contrast to the background and to one another. You can ensure this by running your visualisation through a contrast checker (see resources below). For conformance level AA, a contrast of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text and graphics is required. In addition, avoid the use of colour or contrast as the only means to convey information. Instead, add patterns and labels to ensure readability.","153,104,106,152,77,154",79,,,,

Because your visualisations might reappear in different contexts, it is best to cite the author (the organisation or person that created the visualisation), the data source (the data used to create the visualisation) and the reuse licence (the conditions under which the visualisation might be reused) with each chart.
","The author, data source, and reuse licence are often placed below the visualisation, in the bottom left and right corner. Use a relatively small font size and / or a lighter colour than used in the rest of the chart. If possible, use abbreviations and underlay those abbreviations with links directly to the author, data source and licence description (see recommendation ‘Licence your data visualisations so that others can reuse it’).

For the data source you might choose to use the name of the data provider (e.g., ‘JRC’); or you might use your own reference system to refer to the data source (e.g., Eurostat uses a unique code such as ‘tag00001’ to identify each data set).

For the reuse licence, follow the guidelines applicable to images, photos and illustrations. The copyright notice of a standalone visualisation owned by the European Commission would look like this: © European Union 20XX Licensed under CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Instagram, also allow users to add alt text to their images before posting them.

An easy formula to write alt text goes as follows: [Chart type] of [type of data] where [reason for including the chart]. An example would be: ‘Line chart of the number of hectares burnt in Europe over the year in 2020, 2021 and 2022 where 2022 clearly has the highest rates even though the year is not over yet.’ ","157,156,77",79,,,,
,Prepare Visualisations,DONE,5,Export visualisations separately from the publication,"People who read your publication might want to reuse your visualisations in their own publications and in presentations or share them on social media. Therefore, it makes sense to provide them as separate files, in addition to the main publication.","If you want to provide a closed format that users cannot change by themselves, export the visualisation as a PNG (the ‘Portable Network Graphics’ format). If you want to allow the users to edit the style of the visualisation you can additionally provide a vector-based format such as an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). Consider offering multiple aspect ratios, such as a 16:9 ratio for presentations and a 1:1 ratio for social media. Be sure that the exported visualisations contain metadata (see ‘Add metadata to your visualisation’).",,166,7,,,

By providing tools to search this metadata, the catalogue allows users to find and access the data they need. Data catalogues such as data.europa.eu do not host the data but link to the location where the data can be accessed. ","If your data is open data, you can catalogue it on data.europa.eu. To do so, make a request for data identifiers in DemPub. This is possible regardless of whether you are publishing the publication with the OP or not. Once the request is processed you will get a unique identifier for your data and the data will be included in the data.europa.eu catalogue. Even if data cannot be released as open data, reach out to your Local Data Correspondent about publishing it on the internal EC data catalogue (for European Commission services) or on your institution's internal data catalogue (for other Institutions, agencies and bodies).","84,13,165","80,62,13,",,,,
,Write,FORMATTING,3,"For visualisations that are frequently updated, write generic text","Writing text about data visualisations that are frequently updated with new data is a challenge. However, there are methods that minimise the amount of text that must be completely rewritten every time the data is updated. ","Either one of following concepts can be used when writing about updating visualisations, in order from more to less work per update:
-You can outline trends and developments and update only those specific descriptions.
-You can state only the values without describing any trends. Those numbers can be updated manually or be programmed to update automatically.
-You can abstain from naming trends or specific values and simply introduce the data and the methodology used to create it.

If the data is updated frequently, you might consider creating two separate products: A dashboard that shows previous versions and new updates for people to explore the data; and publications that focus on a particular update and lead the reader through the most interesting findings of that update.

If you write with an online publication in mind, you can ensure a more pleasant reading experience across devices. In addition, a well-defined text layout will make your content machine-readable and accessible, as online search-engines and assistive technologies make use of these definitions.","Some guidelines for web-friendly text include:
-Define clear title hierarchies (3 max.). Consistently use the same font sizes and font styles for each hierarchy. To designate those styles, use HTML-tags online and headings style in Microsoft Word.
-Write in sentences that are concise and are no longer than 25 words.
-Break up your content into short paragraphs of about 1 to 4 sentences. Make sure that the width of these paragraphs in the publication layout is not more than 75 and not less than 45 characters.
-Use hyperlinks to point to further information and original research or data.
-Use the ""inverted pyramid"" structure for your texts: start with the  essential information, then expand on and supplement this information with details and finally add non-crucial background information. ","151,138,140,144,94,95,93,132,88,160",79,"27,35",text-web,,

Therefore, it is important to structure the data in a way that makes it easy for a computer to understand – in a logical, consistent way. ","In structuring your data (i.e., your spreadsheet), there are some simple rules you can follow to make it machine-readable. In the case that you are working with external contractors, make sure to ask the contractor to prepare the data in line with the recommendations we give here.
Do’s
-Give each column a short descriptive heading.
-Use a single header row.
-Ensure you have used the first cell, i.e. A1.
-Avoid white space and additional information in the file.
-Ensure that all rows have the same number of columns.
-Indicate units in an easily processable way.
-Mark null values explicitly as such.
-Encode date and time as ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss). If applicable, the time zone used should be stated (derived from UTC – Coordinated Universal Time).
-Formatting of decimal numbers and numbers in the thousands
-Make use of standardised character encoding
-Use URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify entities

Don’ts
-Don’t use thousand separators such as white spaces and dots.
-Don’t embed charts, comments, or tables within a spreadsheet.
-Don’t use colour coding (machine-based data mining cannot interpret this).
-Don’t include special (i.e., non-alphanumeric) characters within the spreadsheet, including commas.
-Don’t use merged cells.

These text-based file formats are often smaller and can therefore also be downloaded and handled more easily. ","Save your data in a non-proprietary file format, such as CSV (Comma Separated Values) or JSON. You can always provide software-specific formats, such as Excel, additionally for less technical users. When saving your data, deposit each table that is part of the dataset as a separate file. Give the file a name that appropriately reflects its content. When you are using the CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, make sure to use commas as the delimiter (see recommendation ‘Structure your data in a machine-readable format’).

This means that online content needs to responsively adjust to the screen size the reader is using. Data visualisations are no exception: They need to be designed in a way that layout and font-sizes responsively adjust to the width of the screen. ","Often interactive charting tools such as Highcharts come with built-in functionalities for responsive design. If not, check with your developers and designers for which screen sizes you are optimising. In terms of static charts, designers might create multiple versions for different platforms (e.g., one for the PDF-Publication and one for social media platforms).",,,,visualisation-screensizes,,

For another, translated documents ensure democratic discussion and transparency. ","When creating a visualisation for a multilingual publication, keep in mind that titles, keys, labels, and annotations must all be translated. It is therefore important to keep any text in the visualisation short and succinct. When providing the publication to the translation service, ensure that you provide enough context to avoid that those short texts are mistranslated.",,,,,,

For a variety of reasons, many people struggle to read complex texts. Also, especially online, readers mostly do not study unnecessarily complicated texts. Plain language makes your content accessible and easy to consume. ","Some good guidelines include:
-Know your audience and know which terms your audience understands;
-Use simple terms and explain them either on their first occurrence or in a glossary;
-Avoid jargon, synonyms and abbreviations;
-Avoid overcrowding the text with acronyms and abbreviations; spell them out on their first occurrence or add a list of abbreviations to your publication;
-Write in short sentences (20 – 25 words max.) and paragraphs (1 – 4 sentences max.).
