In the case of the European Commission, for example, documents and accompanying data are open data by default. Furthermore, under European law, public administrations that hold ‘high-value datasets’ should make them available free of charge, in machine-readable formats, via an Application Programming Interface (API). ‘High-value datasets’ are datasets associated with important societal and economic benefits, such as geospatial or mobility data.","how":"The 5-star deployment scheme for open data, suggested by Tim Berners-Lee (see ‘Resources’ below), can be a guiding principle.

In HTML, essential accessibility requirements are outlined in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which defines three levels of compliance: A (represents the absolute minimum requirements for basic accessibility), AA, and AAA. Since 2010, all new websites under the EUROPA domain have to be built according to level AA.","how":"The first step is to avoid the use of colour and contrast as the only means to convey information. Additionally encode your data with patterns and labels to ensure readability. \r\n\r\nThen, when it comes to defining your colour palette, pay attention to 1) contrast and 2) to the combination of colours. Contrast is the difference in brightness between two colours. Your colours should have enough contrast to the background and to one another. You can ensure this by running your visualisation through a contrast checker (see 'Resources' below). For conformance level AA, a contrast of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text and graphic elements is required. When it comes to colour combinations, avoid using the following ones: red / green / brown; pink / turquoise / grey; purple / blue.
