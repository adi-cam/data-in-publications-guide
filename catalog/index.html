        Choose the right type of visualisation

      </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Basic</strong>:
        Choose different visualisation types (e.g., bar chart, flow chart, diagram, etc.) depending on the data and on what aspects of your data you want to communicate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Advanced</strong>:
        Once you have found the type you want to use (e.g. a line chart), make design amendments to communicate the information in your data more clearly (e.g. flip the chart 90 Degrees so that the lines run vertically).

        This includes using titles that summarize the main point of the visualisation, sub-headings that describe the units of measurement, precise legends / keys, consistent axes, and appropriate colors. It can also mean showing missing data, uncertainty ranges, trendlines and benchmarks, if the data calls for it.

      <p>
        <strong>Basic</strong>:
        Sometimes it might be important to know the exact value for each data point. In static visualisations, the data values can be shown directly on the chart. If there is not enough place to show all data values, annotate the chart with the most important ones (e.g., minimum, maximum and most recent value). 
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Advanced</strong>:
        Provide the reader with a table view of the graphic. In a static publication format, the table can be shown below or next to the visualisation.

        Make sure to clearly identify the organisation (or person) that created the visualisation. Because your visualisations might be reused in different contexts, it is best to cite the author in each chart.

            <strong>The Guardian</strong>

          Media organisations, such as The Guardian, usually state the name of their organisation as the author directly beneath the visualisation.

      <h2>
        Always cite a data source 
        (Visualization)
      </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Basic</strong>:
        Whether it is your own data or data from a third-party, always clearly identify the source of the data that was used to create the visualisation. As your visualisations might be reused in different contexts, it is best to cite the source with each chart. If possible, add a link that leads directly to that data set or to information on that data set. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Advanced</strong>:
        Be consistent in the way you cite the data source. For example, you might decide to consistently use the name of the data owner and a link to the page that describes that data set.

In a comparative report, provide the source for each data value.

        Provide your visualisations as downloads
        (Visualization)
      </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Basic</strong>:
        Provide an image (best format: PNG) of the visualisation for people to download and reuse. This image should contain metadata about the visualisation, e.g. which institution created it, the year, and link to the data behind it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Advanced</strong>:
        If you want the user to be able to edit the visualisation provide an open, vector-based format such as an SVG in addition to the closed, pixel-based formats such as PNGs and JPEGs.

You might also want to offer different aspect ratios, such as a 16:9 ratio for presentations and a 1:1 ratio for social media. 

Users might want to download all the visualisations and visualised tables from the report at once. Provide a link to a zip-file with all files in different formats.

        Decide the level of interactivity for each chart
        (Visualization)
      </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Basic</strong>:
        Many online charting tools come with integrated, default interactive features and sometimes also animations. These features do not always contribute to the legibility of the visualisations. It's always better to provide static, legible visualisations than distracting interactions that don't serve a purpose.

        (Visualization)
      </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Basic</strong>:
        Increasingly, content is consumed on smaller screens, i.e. mobile devices. This means that online content needs to responsively adjust to the screen size the reader is using. Data visualisations are no exception: They need to be designed for at least two different screen sizes (mobile and desktop) so that they remain legible across devices or be designed in a way that they responsively adjust to the width of the screen.

        Provide an embed code for the visualisation so that users can add your chart to their websites. An embed code is a short script that can be copied and pasted into the code of another website.

        <strong>Basic</strong>:
        In most cases, it is best to use the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC-BY 4.0) license for your data. This license allows users to "copy, modify and distribute data in any format for any purpose, including commercial use.

        <strong>Advanced</strong>:
        There are many different licenses to choose from. Using a license chooser you can also try to find a license that is most specific to your situation than CC-BY 4.0 might be.
